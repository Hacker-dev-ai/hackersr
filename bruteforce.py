**Hackersr** is a powerful and versatile tool designed for developers to perform automated login attempts on various social media platforms. It is a casual and random project in the field of Information Security, offering a robust framework for brute-forcing with advanced features to minimize detection risks.

In today's web applications, brute-forcing is often inefficient due to modern security measures like **Account Locking**. While tools like Hackersr can help uncover passwords, the success of such attempts heavily depends on the target website's security mechanisms.

## **Key Features**

- **Brute Force**: Advanced algorithms for efficient brute-force attacks.
- **Customization**: Flexible parameters to adapt to specific use cases.
- **Multi-threaded**: Concurrent execution for faster results.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for monitoring and debugging.

## **Installation**

Getting started with Hackersr is simple and can be done in just a few steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hacker-dev-ai/hackersr.git
