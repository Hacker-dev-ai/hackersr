# Instagram Brute-Force Attack Simulation (For Educational Purposes)

**Disclaimer:**  
This tool is strictly for cybersecurity awareness and educational demonstrations for law enforcement. It is designed to show how brute-force attacks can compromise weak passwords and emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity best practices. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

## Purpose  
This simulation demonstrates how attackers may attempt to exploit weak passwords on social media platforms like Instagram. The goal is to raise awareness about the importance of strong passwords and account security.

## Features  
- Simulates brute-force login attempts (without targeting any real accounts)  
- Highlights the effectiveness of rate-limiting and two-factor authentication (2FA)  
- Provides insights into how attackers operate and how to defend against such attacks  

## How It Works  
1. **Password Strength Testing** – Tests passwords from a pre-defined weak password list.  
2. **Rate-Limiting Simulation** – Demonstrates how rate-limiting can stop brute-force attacks.  
3. **2FA Awareness** – Explains how two-factor authentication adds an extra security layer.  

## Setup Instructions  
> This project is a simulation only and does not interact with Instagram or any real accounts.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hacker-dev-ai/hackersr.git cd hackersr
   python bruteforce.py
